Open `index.html` in a browser to play a cel-shaded, Christmas-colored Wheel of Time sliding puzzle starring Deedra (Aes Sedai) and Ray (her Warder). Slide tiles into the empty space to form a path between them, then align the three-ring Wheel to view the ending. Fewer moves/time yield a better score. Toggle light/dark from the corner; palette leans red/green/gold/white.

Art assets (auto-loaded if present):
- `assets/deedra.png` (Aes Sedai)
- `assets/ray.png` (Warder)
- `assets/trolloc.png` (Trolloc accent)
If missing, the game falls back to drawn cel-shaded tiles.
