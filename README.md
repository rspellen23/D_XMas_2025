# D_XMas_2025 – Wheel of Christmas Time

Open `index.html` in a browser to play a cel-shaded, Christmas-colored Wheel of Time puzzle starring Deedra (Aes Sedai) and Ray (her Warder). Click tiles to rotate channel paths and connect them through the snow. Fewer moves = better score. Complete the path to see their romantic ending. Toggle light/dark from the corner; palette leans red/green/gold/white.

Art assets (auto-loaded if present):
- `assets/deedra.png` (Aes Sedai)
- `assets/ray.png` (Warder)
- `assets/trolloc.png` (Trolloc accent)
If missing, the game falls back to drawn cel-shaded tiles.

Tech: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (Canvas). Works offline; no build step required.
