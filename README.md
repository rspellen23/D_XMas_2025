# D_XMas_2025 – Wheel of Christmas Time

Open `index.html` in a browser to play a cel-shaded, Christmas-colored Wheel of Time mini-game starring Deedra (Aes Sedai) and Ray (her Warder). Move to dodge, channel blasts (Space), and deliver Warder slashes (F) to clear waves of Trollocs. Survive through the waves to see their romantic ending. Toggle light/dark from the corner; palette leans red/green/gold/white.

If you add art assets, place them as:
- `assets/deedra.png` (Aes Sedai)
- `assets/ray.png` (Warder)
- `assets/trolloc.png` (Trolloc)
The game will auto-use them; it falls back to drawn shapes if missing.

Tech: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (Canvas). Works offline; no build step required.
